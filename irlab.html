<h4 style="color: #2e6c80;">Abstract</h4>
<p> The aim of this project is to review and compare some of the promiment techniques that have been used for Twitter Sentiment Analysis(TSA) in recent literature. 
The case study particularly looks at three type of TSA methods, namely, Lexicon based, Machine Learning based, and combination of both. 
The empirical study involves implementation of these techniques as well as comparsion of their performance on a well-known Twitter dataset. We also aim to provide the detailed results of this comparison and the underlying implemented functions for usage.</p>

<h4 style="color: #2e6c80;">Introduction</h4>
<p>With the booming of microblogs on the Web, people have begun to express their opinions on a wide
variety of topics on Twitter and other similar services. Sentiment analysis on entities (e.g., products,
organizations, people, etc.) in tweets (posts on Twitter) thus becomes a rapid and effective way of
gauging public opinion for business marketing or social studies. However, Twitter's unique characteristics
give rise to new problems for current sentiment analysis methods, which originally focused on large
opinionated corpora such as product reviews. The informal and specialized language used
in tweets, as well as the very nature of the microblogging
domain make Twitter Sentiment Analysis(TSA) a very different
task.</p>

<p>Just in the past few years there have been a number of papers looking at Twitter Sentiment Analysis. As part of this project we review and compare some of the most prominent approaches in the recent literature. In this project, we present three main types of methods of TSA: 1) Lexicon Based Approach [1], [2] with further improvements by adding features of hashtags and emoticons [3], [4] 2) Machine Learning(ML) Approach [5] and 3) Combinations of Lexicon and ML based approaches [6], [7]. The main two methods of sentiment analysis, lexicon-based method (unsupervised
approach) and machine learning based method (supervised approach), both rely on the
bag-of-words. Each of these methods has its advantages and shortcomings which we discuss in the literature survey section. We also plan to show that accuracy of the sentiment analysis for Twitter can be improved by combining the two lexicon and ML based approaches as they complement their individual shortcomings.</p>

<p>Lexicon Based Methodology: Lexicon-based approach calculates the sentiment of a given tweet from the polarity of the
words or phrases in that tweet. For this method a lexicon (a dictionary) of words with assigned polarity is required. Examples of the existing lexicons include: Opinion  Lexicon, SentiWordNet, AFINN Lexicon. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require and labeled training data, but a major shortcoming is that it needs lexicons, to measure polarity scores of words in the tweets and hence this approach faces issue of high precision but low recall.</p>

<p>Machine Learning Based Approach: The machine learning-based approach typically trains sentiment classifiers using features such as unigrams or bigrams. Most techniques use some form of supervised learning by applying different learning techniques such as Naive Bayes(NB), Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines(SVM). These methods need manual labeling of training examples for each application domain. Although it has been show in the past that SVMs with unigrams outperform other approaches, they need labeled training data which is a major disadvantage.</p>

<p>Combinations of Lexicon and ML Based Approach: There has been an increasing interest in combining these two types of approaches to alleviate the issues related with the individual methods. The combined approach benefits in either of the two ways: 1) It uses lexicon based features as additional features to improve the performance of ML based approach 2) It uses lexicons to obtain training data for the ML based approach. This method is hence more desirable for practical applications and experimental results have shown that they outperform other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<h4 style="color: #2e6c80;">Literature Survey</h4>
<p>In the literature survey we review the the three class of methods in detail.</p>

<p><b>Lexicon Based Method:</b> In  the  lexicon-based  method
the unigrams which are found in the lexicon are assigned a polarity score, the overall
polarity score of the text is then computed as sum of the polarities of the unigrams.  For this method a lexicon (a dictionary)
of words with assigned to them polarity is required. Examples of the existing lexicons
include: Opinion  Lexicon,  SentiWordNet, AFINN Lexicon. The sentiment score(S) of the tweet(T)
can be computed as the average of the polarities conveyed by each of the words in the text. The methodology for the sentiment calculation can be described with the following steps:</p>

<p>Pre-processing: The text undergoes pre-processing steps: POS tagging, stemming, stop-words removal, tokenisations into N-grams. The outcome of the pre-processing is a set of tokens or a bag-of-words.</p>

<p>Checking each token for its polarity in the lexicon: Each word from the bag-of-words is compared against the lexicon. If the word is found in the lexicon, the polarity `w' of that word is added to the sentiment score of the text. If the word is
not found in the lexicon its polarity is considered to be equal to zero.</p>

<p>Calculating the sentiment score of the tweet: After assigning polarity scores to all words comprising the tweet, the final sentiment score of the text is calculated by dividing the sum of the scores of words caring the sentiment by the number of such
words.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the biggest advantage of this method is that it does not require any labeled training data for sentiment analysis. But it does require a lexicon, for computing polarity of the words in the tweets. Hence it majorly depends on how many words does the lexicon contain that are found in the text. This makes the approach susceptible to high precision but low recall issues.</p>

<p><b>ML Based Approach:</b> A Machine Learning Approach for TSA is a supervised algorithm that analyses
data that were previously labelled as positive,
negative or neutral; extracts features that model
the  differences  between  different  classes,  and
infers a function, that can be used for classifying new examples unseen before.</p>

<p>The most popular learning algorithms for TSA are Support Vector Machines  (SVMs),  Naive  Bayes, Decision Trees. In previous SVMs have shown the best performance with unigram features. Further, decision tree classifier
was shown to perform nearly as well as an SVM classifier. The process of machine learning text classification can be broken into the following
steps:</p>

<p>Data  Pre-processing: Before  training  the  classifiers  each  text  needs  to  be  pre-
processed and presented as an array of tokens.</p>

<p>Feature generation: Features are tweet attributes that are useful for capturing patterns  in  data.  The  most  popular  features  used  in  machine  learning  classification are the presence or the frequency of unigrams extracted during the pre-processing step. Apart from the n-grams, additional features can be created to improve the over-
all quality of text classification. The most common features that are used for this
purpose include: Number of words with positive/negative sentiment; Number of negations; Length of a message; Number of exclamation marks; Number of different parts-of-speech in a text (for example, number of nouns,
adjectives, verbs) etc.</p>

<p>Learning an Algorithm: After feature generation steps the data is represented in a form that can be used to train an algorithm. Even though many classifiers have been tested for TSA purposes, we aim to SVM as SVMs have shown to outperform other classification techniques.</p>

<p><b>Combination Method:</b> Accuracy of the sentiment analysis for Twitter can be improved by combining the Lexicon and ML approaches. This is beneficial for two reasons. First, these techniques can demonstrate better performance compared to individual techniques. Secondly, they help overcome the issues related to the Lexicon and ML based methods. By combining the two, not only the recall is improved, but also the need for labeled training is data is also alleviated. The combination of these methods generally takes place in two ways where either lexicon scores are used as additional features for ML based method or lexicons are used to obtain additional training data for ML based approach. For the first appproach, during the first stage a lexicon score is calculated based on the polarity of the words which
compose the text, during the second stage a machine learning model is learnt that uses
the lexicon score as one of the features.</p> 

<p>In the second method, first a lexicon-based method is employed for entity-
level sentiment analysis. This is useful to extract some
additional opinionated indicators (e.g. words and to-
kens) on the results of
the lexicon-based method. With the help of the new
opinionated indicators, additional opinionated tweets
can be identified. Afterwards, a sentiment classifier is
trained to assign sentiment polarities for entities in the
newly-identified tweets. The training data for the clas-
sifier is the result of the lexicon-based method. Thus,
the whole process has no manual labeling. The pro-
posed approach is an unsupervised method except for
the initial opinion lexicon, which is publicly available.</p>
